# plugin.video.itunes_podcasts
XBMC Video-/Audio-Plugin to access Apple iTunes Podcasts

# State of affairs
absolutely minimal edits to get this to load/run/play existing favorites/bookmarks in Kodi 19 Matrix.

Language files need serious overhaul, https://gitlab.com/ronie/script.language-convert/ should help but breaks - so no UI in this version.

Playback works if you know where to click ;-)
